# Task: Update and Optimize CLAUDE.md

Maintain a clean, focused, and accurate CLAUDE.md file for this project.

## Principles

**CLAUDE.md is shared as context in EVERY Claude Code session.**
- Keep it under 150-250 lines for most projects
- Focus on patterns and principles, not verbose documentation
- Remove redundancy and one-time setup instructions
- Prioritize actionable information that helps code effectively

## Step 1: Read Current State

Read the existing `CLAUDE.md` file to understand its current structure and content.

## Step 2: Understand the Codebase

Explore the project comprehensively to gather accurate knowledge:

1. **Discover the technology stack**
   - Find and read the primary configuration file (package.json, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.)
   - Identify the language, framework, and runtime
   - Note the package/dependency manager

2. **Map the project structure**
   - Use Glob to discover source files and their extensions
   - Identify key directories and their purposes
   - Understand the architectural layout

3. **Identify core systems**
   - Authentication/authorization approach
   - Database or data layer architecture
   - API patterns and endpoints
   - External service integrations

4. **Find the patterns**
   - How are common tasks accomplished in this codebase?
   - What are the established conventions?
   - What design patterns are in use?

5. **Note environment requirements**
   - Required environment variables
   - Configuration needs
   - Development setup requirements

## Step 3: Reconcile and Optimize

Compare codebase reality with current documentation:

**Verify accuracy:**
- Are commands still correct?
- Are dependencies/versions current?
- Are file paths and structures accurate?
- Are environment variables complete?

**Cut aggressively:**
- Remove full code blocks that duplicate source files
- Eliminate verbose explanations
- Delete troubleshooting that's one-time setup
- Remove checklists and detailed how-tos
- Consolidate repetitive information
- Cut "why this matters" philosophical sections

**Keep the essentials:**
- Architecture decisions and patterns
- Essential development commands
- Coding conventions and best practices
- Common code patterns (brief examples only)
- Critical gotchas and non-obvious behaviors
- Design system rules (if applicable)

## Step 4: Structure for Scanning

Organize into clear sections appropriate for this project type:

**Universal sections:**
- Project Overview (tech stack, key philosophy)
- Package Manager (which tool to use)
- Development Commands (essential workflows)
- Architecture Principles (key decisions and patterns)
- Project Structure (directory layout)
- Common Patterns (brief code examples)
- Development Notes (gotchas, quirks)
- Coding Principles (team conventions)

**Conditional sections:**
- Design System (if frontend project)
- Database Schema (high-level only, reference source files)
- Environment Variables (list required, no values)
- Deployment Notes (if relevant to development)

## Step 5: Write the Optimized Version

Update CLAUDE.md with:
- ✅ Scannable structure with clear headers
- ✅ Concise, actionable content
- ✅ Accurate reflection of current codebase
- ✅ Focus on patterns, not verbose docs
- ✅ Technology-appropriate guidance
- ✅ Minimal redundancy

## Output Summary

Provide:
- Line count: before → after
- Major changes made
- Sections removed/added
- Key corrections applied
